# Installations and their usability

## Type ORM

TypeORM is an ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8). Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases - from small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications with multiple databases.

[TypeORM](http://typeorm.io) module for [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest).

```
npm i @nestjs/typeorm typeorm
```

## Config

Configuration module for [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) based on the [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) (to load process environment variables) package.

```
npm i @nestjs/config
```

## PG

Non-blocking `PostgreSQL` client for Node.js. Pure JavaScript and optional native libpq bindings.

```
npm i pg
```

## Axios

`Axios` is richly featured HTTP client package that is widely used. Nest wraps Axios and exposes it via the built-in HttpModule. The HttpModule exports the HttpService class, which exposes Axios-based methods to perform HTTP requests. The library also transforms the resulting HTTP responses into Observables.

```
npm i @nestjs/axios
```

## Class Transformer

Its ES6 and Typescript era. Nowadays you are working with classes and constructor objects more than ever. Class-transformer allows you to transform plain object to some instance of class and versa. Also it allows to serialize / deserialize object based on criteria. This tool is super useful on both frontend and backend.

```
npm i class-transformer
```

## Class Validator

Allows use of decorator and non-decorator based validation. Internally uses validator.js to perform validation. Class-validator works on both browser and node.js platforms.

```
npm i class-validator
```

## Schedule

Schedule module for Nest based on the cron package

```
npm i @nestjs/schedule
```

## CRON

This package contains type definitions for [cron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron).

```
npm i -D @types/cron
```
